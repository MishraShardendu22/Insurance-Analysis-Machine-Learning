# Insurance Exploratory Data Analysis

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing insurance data using Python, Pandas, and data visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

This project performs detailed exploratory data analysis on an insurance dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization. The analysis covers key machine learning concepts and data preprocessing techniques essential for building predictive models.

## Contents

- **Insurance.ipynb** - Main Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis with code cells and visualizations
- **Project-Insurance.md** - Documentation with key concepts and EDA methodology
- **README.md** - This file

## Key Concepts Covered

### Data Preprocessing
- **inplace=True** - Modifying DataFrames in-place vs. creating new copies
- **Target Variables** - Identifying dependent variables for supervised learning
- **One-Hot Encoding** - Converting categorical features into binary columns
- **Feature Scaling** - Standardization using Z-score normalization

### EDA Steps
1. **Setup** - Configure environment and suppress warnings
2. **Data Exploration** - Inspect structure, data types, and missing values
3. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values and outliers
4. **Feature Engineering** - Create and transform features
5. **Visualization** - Generate plots and charts to understand patterns

## Technologies & Libraries

- **Python** - Programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebook environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Insurance.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute cells sequentially to see the analysis and visualizations
3. Refer to Project-Insurance.md for conceptual explanations

## Key Analysis Areas

- Dataset structure and summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Feature distributions
- Categorical variable relationships
- Correlation analysis
- Data preparation for modeling

## Notes

The notebook contains output cells with visualizations and data summaries that illustrate key findings from the insurance data analysis.
